RemoteDialer follows a pre-release (v0.x) strategy of semver. There is limited compatibility between releases, though we do aim to avoid breaking changes on minor version lines. 

The current supported release lines are:

| RemoteDialer Branch | RemoteDialer Minor version | Matching Rancher Version |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| main | v0.5 | v2.12
| release/v0.4 | v0.4 | v2.11.4+
| release/v0.3 | v0.3 | v2.10, v2.11.0 - v2.11.3
